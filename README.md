# Open Corporates REST API

Golang API for accessing the [Open Corporates REST API](https://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/API-Reference) service.

**Note:** This is not (currently) intended to provide a fully functional
API client supporting the full gamut of the API, simply a way of providing the
data which is useful to our own systems. It is anticpiated that this will
evolve over time though as necessary.
